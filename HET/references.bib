abstract = "A new robust optimisation algorithm, which can be regarded
                  as a modification of the recently developed cuckoo
                  search, is presented. The modification involves the
                  addition of information exchange between the top
                  eggs, or the best solutions. Standard optimisation
                  benchmarking functions are used to test the effects
                  of these modifications and it is demonstrated that,
                  in most cases, the modified cuckoo search performs
                  as well as, or better than, the standard cuckoo
                  search, a particle swarm optimiser, and a
                  differential evolution strategy. In particular the
                  modified cuckoo search shows a high convergence rate
                  to the true global minimum even at high numbers of
                  dimensions. "
